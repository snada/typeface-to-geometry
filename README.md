## Build and run

If you don't use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), you really really should (even on [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)).

Make sure you're running node 6.9.1:

`nvm install 6.9.1 && nvm use 6.9.1`

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Once that is done, you can launch it with:

`npm start`
